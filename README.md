## Glassdoor-Salary-Analysis-DS
This is salary analysis of glassdoor job data exclusively in Us for Data Scientists. This project has been done by closely follwing @ken jee my favorite DS on youtube .
Couple of items to note:

  ---> I didnt have headquarters and Competitors data (i am not sure why because i am fetching the data from India). 
  ---> I have choosen US because in India i couldn't find salary estimate.
  ---> Glassdoor scraper is written based on Selenium and pandas ...this code has been provided by Omer sakariya and further modified by Kenjee and further by me(the changes are not huge ...like we were not able to fetch salary for some)
  
  This is a very enjoyable experience atleast till the data cleaning stage .(since i am here at the moment a)
